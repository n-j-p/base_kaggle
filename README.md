# Skeleton repo for kaggle competitions

1. Rename repo from "base_kaggle". Directory name change, as well as the import statements in base_kaggle/*.py files, and the last line in pyproject.toml
2. Change competition name and other info in 'competition_info.txt'
3. Run 'py scripts/download_data.py' to create local copy of competition files. (You need to be registered with the kaggle API - https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api - and have a token set up.)
